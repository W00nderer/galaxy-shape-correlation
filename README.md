# 2D Elliptical Galaxy Simulation

This project explores scientific programming through the simulation of 2D elliptical objects (galaxies) and the computation of their shape correlation function as a function of distance.

The simulation demonstrates that nearby objects with radial alignments exhibit significant correlations, whereas randomly oriented objects show no notable correlation.

All theory, methodology, and code explanations are provided within the source code.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions regarding the code and/or theory. Thank you!
